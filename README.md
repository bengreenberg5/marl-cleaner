Custom implementation of the Cleaner Game described [here](https://github.com/Bigpig4396/Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-Environment/blob/master/env_Cleaner/Cleaner.pdf).

This work was completed as part of SERI's Summer Research Program. The repo is still in progress as of 2021-09-10 -- by 2021-09-14, I will hopefully have added tests, typing, requirements, documentation, and a more fleshed-out README.
